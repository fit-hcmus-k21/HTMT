2. Assuming a cache of 4K blocks, a four-word block size, and a 32-bit address, find the
total number of sets and the total number of tag bits for caches that are direct mapped,
two-way and four-way set associative, and fully associative.

xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xx 		xx
				Block						word
											
4 Bytes / block
-> number of word bits = 2

2^32 Bytes / 4(block size) = 2^30 blocks
-> number of block bits = 30

- Full associate:
xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xx 		xx
				Tag/Block					word
number of tag bits = number of block bits = 30

- Direct mapping:
xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xx		xx xxxx xxxx xx 		xx
		tag						line
				Block								word
2^30 blocks / 2^12 lines = 2^18
-> number of tag bits = 18
cache: 4K blocks = 2^12 lines
-> number of line bits = 12

- 2-way set associate:
xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxx		x xxxx xxxx xx 		xx
		tag						set
				Block							word
2^12 lines / 2 lines (set size) = 2^11 sets
-> number of set bits = 11
2^30 blocks / 2^11 sets = 2^19
-> number of tag bits = 19

- 4-way set associate:
xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx 	xxxx xxxx xx 		xx
		tag						set
				Block							word
2^12 lines / 4 lines (set size) = 2^10 sets
-> number of set bits = 10
2^30 blocks / 2^10 sets = 2^20
-> number of tag bits = 20
